# deep_learning
Stanford University - Machine Learning by Andrew Ng from Coursera.  
This repository stores the progress of my lab assignments from the Coursera Machine Learning course.  
However, it is mainly a placeholder for my Coursera certificates, and includes a submodule reference to a private repository that actually contains the completed assignments.

Status:  
Course 1, Neural Nets and Deep Learning:      COMPLETE  
Course 2, Improving Deep Neural Networks:     COMPLETE  
Course 3, Structuring ML Projects:              
Course 4, Convolutional Neural Networks:      IN PROGRESS  
Course 5, Sequence Models:
